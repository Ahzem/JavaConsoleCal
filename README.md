## Description
This is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. It is a console application that takes in two numbers and an operator from the user and then performs the operation on the two numbers. The user can choose to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The result of the operation is then displayed to the user. The calculator also handles division by zero and invalid input from the user. The user can choose to perform another operation or exit the program. The calculator is written in Java and uses the Scanner class to take input from the user. It is a simple and easy-to-use calculator that can be used for basic arithmetic calculations.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
